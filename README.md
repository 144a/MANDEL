# MANDEL

I always thought the Mandelbrot set was a fascinating fractal. Both the fractal produce and the math behind it are amazing. This lead me to a thought one day: "Can you generate it on a calculator?". The answer is...   of course you can! It just takes over 5 hours for it to completely generate the fractal (and don't even think about zooming in). This version incudes multiple colors to show the value at which it "escapes" the function at different intervals. Run with the calculator plugged in, as you can't do much with it while it is running.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
